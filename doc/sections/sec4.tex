\section{Documents Similarity Program}

In this section, we write a Python program that uses previous 
implementations. The program is going to read two texts from 
files that are given by system arguments through the execution 
terminal and is going to print the Similarity and Dependency score 
with the LCS strings. Afterward, will plot the distribution of LCS 
occurrence in both text1 and text2. Before that, for making life easier
, we create Class is called \textbf{Docs_Sim} that have all the functionality
we need for comparing two documents. The code is shown in the Listing \ref{lis:docs}

\pythonexternal[caption= \textit{Docs_Sim} class Implementation,label=lis:docs]{codes/docs-sim.py}

Using class \textit{Docs_Sim} Listing \ref{lis:main} shows a program that takes two files as input.
And print resulted score on Console with plot that shows the distribution of LCS occurances.

\pythonexternal[caption=Python program using previous Implementation,label=lis:main]{codes/main1.py}

The execution of the program is shown in Figure \ref{fig:exe}. \textit{text1.txt}
and \textit{text2.txt} contains Text1 and Text2 that were shown in the
Table \ref{tab:table1}. The plot is going to be similar to Figure \ref{fig:dist}. As
you can see, the Similarity score of texts is 42.77\% and Inclusion score
(the rate the smaller text depends on the bigger text) is 64.15\%.

\begin{fig-terminal}{Execution of program in Listing \ref{lis:main}}{fig:exe}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=BASH]
$ ./main.py text1.txt text2.txt
Similarity Score: 42.77%  
Dependency Score of text1 on text2: 64.15%  
Dependency Score of text2 on text1: 56.20%
